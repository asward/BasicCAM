Basic CAM
------------

Basic CAM provides a .Net Standard library and Web Assembly front end to generating simple 2D GCode files from source CAD (.dxf). Once loaded the GCode solution can be manipulated to change preferences of GCode generation, add multiple passes, scale, and offset the original DXF segments to account of laser/cutter widths.

Basic CAM depends on DXF Reader, which has basic support for DXF entities such as lines, arcs, circles, etc.
